							Joining Worcester Underwater Hockey Club is easy and affordable.
							Our club fee is just R50 per month, which helps us maintain
							equipment and support the sport locally. Training takes place at
							The Gym Worcester , where members pay a separate gym fee
							(currently R300 per month, subject to change by the gym). We train
							Mondays and Wednesdays from 18:00–19:30 and Saturdays from
							13:00–14:30. Whether you’re new to the sport or an experienced
							player, our sessions are open to all fitness levels—just bring
							your energy and enthusiasm!
